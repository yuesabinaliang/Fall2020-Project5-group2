+ Project summary: Used two LSTM models (sklearn LSTM and TextBlob), to classify the sentiment of Donald Trump's tweets during the peak of the trade war (January 2018- December 2019). We filtered his tweets for content related to the trade war, then regressed the polarity of his tweets against the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the ETF's FXI and S&P 500 which track the largest companies in China and US respectively. 

	First, we used intra-day 30 minute intervals from the stock exchanges and regressed this against Trump's tweets thoughout the day. These results proved poor, so we changed our approach and aggregated the sentiment of Trump's trade war related tweets into two sections: while the stock market was open and closed (time zones were accounted for). This yielded better results, with a Point-biserial correlation coefficient of 0.XX for sklearn LSTM and 0.XX for TextBlob LSTM. After this regression, we decided to randomly sample and check the results of the Sentiment Analysis. We found that, the LSTM and TextBlob results greatly differed from the team member's personal evaluations. Sklearn's LSTM agreed with team members evaluates 46% of the time, whereas, Textblob had a 59% similarity. Due to this, our recommendation to improve on this work would be to refine the NLP models and try to imbude context into the Sentiment Analysis.

**Contribution statement**: 
+ Elise Nguyen : gathered financial data for S&P, BABA intraday 30 minute prices, processed and merged these data with lstm and textblob data, ran regression & find correlation. Found ways to improve results (i.e. try daily prices, evaluate NLP algorithms performance, evaluate Trump's tweets). Did same thing with S&P, SSE, and FXI index daily prices. Helped put together ppt presentation. Manually went through 100 tweets and categorized into positive, negative and neutral sentiments.
	
+ Natalie Williams : made the preliminary Sentiment Analysis model to determine the feasibility of the project. She acquired the data sets that would be used for training and testing the LSTM Natural Language Processing Models. She implemented two different LSTM's models (balanced and unbalanced) and balanced the highly imbalanced dataset that would serve as the model training data. She also assisted with preparing the presentation files. Manually went through 100 tweets and classify as positive, negative or neutral for comparison with model results. 

+ Yue Liang : Proposed the project and model; collected the dataset of trump's tweets; preprocessed the dataset with natural language processing models; trained the Textblob Sentiment Analysis model; predict the sentiment analysis for trump's tweets; collected and preprocessed the financial data of Chinese Market Index with 30 minutes timeframe; filtered the tweets to China-related tweets; assisted converting the time of the tweets to the time zone of the financial indexes; assisted with aggregation of the sentiment analysis outcome into one-day sentiment outcome; prepared the main file and knitted to pdf files; formated notebook and organized the files in Github; formated the presentation slides. 

+ Luyao Sun : Sliced the dataset of trump's tweets; assisted with the training of Textblob model and filtering the tweets to China-related tweets; converted the time of the tweets to the time zone of the financial indexes; conducted aggregation of the sentiment analysis outcome into one-day sentiment outcome.
